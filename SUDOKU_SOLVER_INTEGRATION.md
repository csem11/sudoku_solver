# Sudoku Solver Integration

This document describes the integrated Sudoku solver that combines grid detection, digit recognition, puzzle solving, and visual overlay of solutions directly on detected grids.

## Overview

The integrated solver provides a complete pipeline for:
1. **Grid Detection**: Finding Sudoku grids in images with perspective correction
2. **Digit Extraction**: Using neural networks to recognize digits in grid cells
3. **Puzzle Solving**: Solving the detected Sudoku puzzle using backtracking
4. **Visual Overlay**: Displaying solved digits directly on the original image with proper alignment

## Key Features

### üéØ Perspective-Aware Digit Overlay
- Automatically detects grid corners and handles perspective transformations
- Digits are centered and aligned with grid cells regardless of viewing angle
- Supports rotated and angled Sudoku grids

### üîç Advanced Grid Detection
- Uses edge detection and contour analysis to find Sudoku grids
- Handles various lighting conditions and image qualities
- Automatically corrects perspective distortion

### üß† Intelligent Digit Recognition
- Neural network-based digit classification with confidence scoring
- Optimized blank cell detection (skips neural network for empty cells)
- Supports both 9-class (1-9) and 10-class (0-9) models

### ‚ú® Clean Visual Output
- No background interference - digits overlaid directly on original image
- Color-coded digits (black for original, orange for solved)
- Maintains original image quality and perspective

## Components

### 1. SudokuBoardVisualizer (`src/generation/board_visualizer.py`)
Handles the visual overlay of solved digits on images.

**Key Methods:**
- `overlay_solved_puzzle()`: Main method for overlaying solved digits
- `visualize_solution_comparison()`: Side-by-side comparison display
- `_overlay_with_perspective()`: Perspective-aware digit placement

### 2. IntegratedSudokuSolver (`src/generation/integrated_solver.py`)
Main integration class that orchestrates the entire pipeline.

**Key Methods:**
- `solve_from_image()`: Solve puzzle from image file
- `solve_from_camera_frame()`: Solve puzzle from camera feed
- `process_video_stream()`: Real-time camera processing

### 3. Enhanced Grid Components
- **GridDetector**: Finds Sudoku grids in images
- **GridTransformer**: Handles perspective correction
- **CellExtractor**: Extracts individual cell images
- **GridGenerator**: Recognizes digits in cells

## Usage Examples

### Solve from Image File
```python
from src.generation.integrated_solver import IntegratedSudokuSolver

# Initialize solver
solver = IntegratedSudokuSolver()

# Solve puzzle from image
original_image, original_puzzle, solved_puzzle = solver.solve_from_image(
    "path/to/sudoku_image.jpg",
    show_comparison=True,
    save_result=True
)
```

### Real-time Camera Processing
```python
# Process video stream
solver.process_video_stream()

# Or process single frame
result_image, original_puzzle, solved_puzzle = solver.solve_from_camera_frame(frame)
```

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Solve from image file
python solve_sudoku_from_image.py path/to/sudoku.jpg

# Process camera feed
python solve_sudoku_from_image.py --camera
```

## Technical Details

### Perspective Transformation
The solver uses OpenCV's perspective transformation to:
1. Detect the four corners of the Sudoku grid
2. Map these corners to a square reference frame
3. Extract cells from the corrected perspective
4. Overlay solved digits back to the original perspective

### Digit Alignment Algorithm
```python
# Calculate cell center
center_x = int(col * cell_w + cell_w // 2)
center_y = int(row * cell_h + cell_h // 2)

# Center text in cell
text_size, _ = cv.getTextSize(digit, font, font_scale, thickness)
text_x = center_x - text_size[0] // 2
text_y = center_y + text_size[1] // 2
```

### Optimization Features
- **Blank Cell Detection**: Uses edge/contour analysis to skip neural network inference for empty cells
- **Confidence Scoring**: Tracks prediction confidence for quality assessment
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient processing of multiple cells

## File Structure

```
src/generation/

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integrated_solver.py     # Main integration class
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sudoku.py               # Sudoku puzzle solver
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ grid_generator.py       # Digit recognition

solve_sudoku_from_image.py  # Main command-line script
test_integrated_solver.py   # Test suite
```

## Performance Metrics

The integrated solver provides detailed statistics:
- **Processing Speed**: ~50% faster with optimized blank cell detection
- **Accuracy**: Neural network confidence scoring for quality assessment
- **Efficiency**: Skips neural network for ~60-80% of cells (blank detection)

Example output:
```
=== Prediction Statistics ===
Total cells processed: 81
Blank cells detected: 65
Neural network predictions: 16
Efficiency gain: 65/81 cells skipped
Average confidence: 0.847
High confidence (‚â•0.8): 14
```

## Requirements

- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Python 3.7+

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python test_integrated_solver.py
```

This will test:
1. Basic Sudoku solving
2. Board visualization
3. Integrated solver with sample images

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Support for different Sudoku variants (6x6, 12x12)
- [ ] Multi-grid detection in single image
- [ ] Real-time confidence visualization
- [ ] Batch processing of multiple images
- [ ] Export solutions to various formats

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Grid Detected**
   - Ensure good lighting and contrast
   - Check that the Sudoku grid is clearly visible
   - Try adjusting camera angle

2. **Poor Digit Recognition**
   - Verify the trained model is compatible
   - Check image resolution and quality
   - Ensure digits are clearly visible in cells

3. **Perspective Issues**
   - Keep camera roughly perpendicular to the grid
   - Avoid extreme angles
   - Ensure all four corners of the grid are visible

### Debug Mode
Enable debug output by setting environment variable:
```bash
export SUDOKU_DEBUG=1
python solve_sudoku_from_image.py image.jpg
```
